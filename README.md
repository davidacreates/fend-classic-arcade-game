# Overview
This game is a take on the classic arcade game Frogger.

# How The Game Works

## Basic Functionality

### The Players
In this game you have one Player and three Enemies(bugs).

### The Goal
The goal is to advance your player past all of the enemies without colliding and successfully make it to the water.

### The Game Play
The player can move in all directions (left, right, up, down) using their keyboard arrow keys. If your Player collides with one of the Enemies, the game is reset and your position returns to the start.
### Winning The Game
If your player makes it to the water without colliding with an enemy, congratulations you have won! You can either quit or replay the game.
